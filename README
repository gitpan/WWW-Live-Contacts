WWW::Live::Contacts
-------------------

This package provides a Perl interface to the Windows Live Contacts API.

NOTE: Microsoft have deprecated the Windows Live Contacts API in favour of
      Windows Live Messenger Connect.

Licensing:

This package is copyrighted and licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser GPL.
You are free to modify and distribute modified version of the software under its
terms.

Requirements:

The "WWW::Live::Auth" package is required for performing delegated
authentication. This allows users to grant access to their contacts data for
your application.

Installation:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Example Application:

An example CGI script "live_contacts.cgi" is included in the "eg" directory,
designed to run in conjunction with the "live_auth.cgi" example script supplied
with the WWW::Live::Auth CPAN module.

To run the application, you must:
  1. Register a web application with Microsoft at the following URL:
     https://manage.dev.live.com/AddApplication.aspx
  2. Add the application ID and secret key to the "example.key" file provided
     with the WWW::Live::Auth package.
  3. Place the key file, along with live_contacts.cgi AND live_auth.cgi in the
     same web server directory. The web server does not need to be
     internet-accessible for the purposes of the example, but CGI scripts must
     of course be enabled.
  4. Point your browser at the live_contacts.cgi script on your web server.
  5. At first usage, your browser should be redirected to Windows Live for you
     to login and grant access to the example application.
  6. After granting consent, you should be redirected to live_auth.cgi, which
     should in turn redirect you to live_contacts.cgi, which will list all your
     contacts.
  7. Subsequent visits to live_contacts.cgi will not require redirection and
     authentication, provided the user's consent has not expired.
